# "Shanel Made This" Portfolio Website

### Description

A website to showcase my skills, experience, and work as a web developer and graphic designer. I would like to start doing freelance work and this website will allow potential clients to see what I can offer&nbsp;them.

### Tools I Used:

-   HTML5
-   CSS3
-   JavaScript
-   [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
-   [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)

### Features & Functionality

-   Fixed header for easy navigation of&nbsp;site
-   Hover animations on&nbsp;buttons
-   Hover effects on links and project&nbsp;cards
-   Click to zoom on design section&nbsp;images
-   Fully responsive from desktop to&nbsp;mobile
-   Built with accessibility in&nbsp;mind

### Challenges and Learning Opportunities

-   I wanted a small hover animation on the buttons to make them stand out. I was able to convert some code I used on a [previous project](https://shanelbb-creative.netlify.app/index.html) to work for this&nbsp;site.
-   I wanted the nav menu to change to a drop down menu on mobile so I used a couple of font awesome icons (bars and x-mark) and the CSS display property to replace the menu on mobile. I used JavaScript to create a click event to toggle the bars icon to an x-mark icon and to open and close the dropdown&nbsp;menu.
-   I also used CSS classes and JavaScript to create a click event that makes the design section images zoom&nbsp;in.
    -   I initially tried to use a hover effect but it created a bug that caused the images to zoom incorrectly. With the JavaScript function I was able to change the position property on both the image and it's container so it displayed&nbsp;properly.

### In the Future

-   I want to try implementing GSAP for some simple&nbsp;animations.
-   I may expand the design section to have it's own&nbsp;page.
